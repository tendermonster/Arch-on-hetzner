# arch-on-hetzner
script that installs arch linux on hetzner server

Gennerally it also should work on other servers with similar setup.

As for hetzner ender rescue (64bit) mode with given password and restart server. 

After that download script to /tmp with wget -P /tmp "link of the script"
and start with with sh install.sh

DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT WITHOUT READING IT! It might need some adjustements
